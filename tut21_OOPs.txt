C++ --> Initially Called --> C with Classes 
Class --> Extension of Structures

Structure Limitation
    -- Members are Public
    -- No Methods

Classes = Structures + More
    Classes can have method and Properties
    Classes can make few mwmbers private and Public

Structures in C++ are typedefed

We can Declare objects right after class declaration
Like This

    Class Employee {
        //Code
    }akash, harry;

akash.salary = value --> it makes no sense if salary is private.
